# CensusAPI
Introduction:
This is a group assessment that builds on the group exercise with Census API data.

Content:
This repository contains four Jupyter Notebooks calling to the Annual Business Surveys (ABS) APIs from the US Census. Each Notebook calls to one of the four datasets in the ABS: Company Summary, Characteristics of Businesses, Characteristics of Business Owners, and Technology Characteristics of Businesses. The pandas library was used to extract, clean, and transform the data. The Notebooks also contain visualizations created using data from the ABS. The visualizations were created using the matplotlib and seaborn libraries. The ETL Report is also included to show how the data was extracted, transformed, and loaded for the group to use. Finally, the Project Report is included to bring all the visualizations together and summarize the group's findings.
