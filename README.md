# CensusAPI
Introduction
This is a group assessment that builds on the group exercise with Census API data.

Part 1: Get into Groups and Review the API
Get into groups and review the following materials:

Data provider: Census Bureau - https://api.census.gov/data.html
Specific dataset: Annual Business Survey (ABS) APIs for 2019: https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/abs.2019.html
Get an API key: https://www.census.gov/data/developers/guidance/api-user-guide.Help_&_Contact_Us.html
Part 2: Explore the Dataset
Explore each of the endpoints individually to understand what data they provide. Explore them wholly to see how they connect.

You will have to consume the API, clean data, merge data, and transform data in order to show how they wholly connect.

Create visualizations as you explore using at least 2 visualization packages and at least 3 different visualizations per user in your group.

What have you found out about your data?

Part 3: Present your Exploration
You will be presenting your findings to the class.

Keep in mind that this is showing exploration.

Your instructors will give feedback on the presentation and what all needs done

Part 4: Write an ETL Report
As a group:

Write a report that details your steps in cleaning your data. This report may be given to another group in order to replicate your research and verify your claims.
If the order matters in how the steps are taken, make sure to use numbered steps.
If the order matters in how tables are combined, be explicit in stating that order.
If you used a Jupyter Notebook to do the ETL process, you can submit the Jupyter Notebook for this part. Be sure to use text blocks to explain the processes rather than letting the code explain itself.
Part 5: Write a Project Report
As a group:

Incorporate the feedback from the presentation into your project.
Write a formal technical report that formally explains your research - including:
Identifying and citing your data sources
Listing your initial questions
Explaining the process to answer those questions
Answering those questions or indicating if more research may be needed. If more research is needed, suggest what research may need to be done.
Format the report professionally. Suppose you are presenting this to your future employers. What would you want them to see?
Run spellcheck.
Run grammar check.
Part 6: Check the Project into GitHub
As a group:

Create a GitHub repository for your group's presentation materials.
Include all code for processing the API data.
This code should all be stored in a Jupyter Notebook.
All visualizations need to be created in Python.
Be sure to show use of pandas for cleaning, merging, and transforming data.
Include the report in your GitHub repository.
Create a detailed README.md that introduces your repository and sets the expectations on where to find things.
Submit a link to your GitHub repository.
